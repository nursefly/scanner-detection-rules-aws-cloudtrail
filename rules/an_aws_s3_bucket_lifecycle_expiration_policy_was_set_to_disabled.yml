name: An AWS S3 bucket lifecycle expiration policy was set to disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect if an AWS S3 lifecycle expiration policy is disabled in your CloudTrail logs.

  ## Strategy
  Check if the lifecycle configuration has fields indicating a disabled status and an event name of PutBucketLifecycle. If these conditions are met, a bucket's lifecycle configuration has been turned off.

  ## Triage & Response
  1. Determine if the event should have occurred on the specified bucket by the identified user and account.
  2. If the bucket should not be disabled, escalate to engineering for re-enablement.
