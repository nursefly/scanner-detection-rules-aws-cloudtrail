name: AWS principal added to multiple EKS clusters
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an AWS principal is granted permissions on multiple Amazon EKS clusters in a short period, indicating a potential compromise of your AWS environment.

  ## Strategy
  This rule triggers if CreateAccessEntry or AssociateAccessPolicy events occur for the same AWS principal on more than 5 unique EKS clusters.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the grantee should have permissions on the target EKS clusters.
  2. Assess if the grantor should have provided those permissions.
  3. If the API calls were not made by the user:
     * Rotate user credentials.
     * Review other API calls made by the user.
     * Revert the permissions change by removing the access entry.
  4. If the API calls were made by the user:
     * Evaluate if the user should be granting access to the cluster.
     * If not, investigate other API calls made by the user for further implications.
