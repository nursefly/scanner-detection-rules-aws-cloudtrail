name: Additional AWS regions enabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when additional AWS regions have been enabled.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for the enabling of additional AWS regions. Attackers may do this to create more resources, such as EC2 instances or ECS clusters, for cryptomining.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Verify if the API call was legitimate based on the event name, user identity, and IP address.
  2. If the action is legitimate, consider adding the user to a suppression list.
  3. If the action is suspicious:
     - Contact the user to confirm whether they made the API call.
     - Check the user investigation dashboard for other actions taken by the user.
     - Investigate the IP for any unusual traffic patterns.
  4. If evidence suggests an attack, initiate the incident response process and conduct a thorough investigation.
