name: Amazon Bedrock activity InvokeModel multiple regions using a long-term access
  key
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect attempts to use InvokeModel in multiple regions.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for any attempts to use the InvokeModel API call in multiple regions from a long-term access key. Attackers typically target the AWS Bedrock service to host their own LLM services using victim resources.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Verify if the API call (the event name) should have been made by the user (the user's ARN) from the specified IP address (the client IP).
  2. If the action is legitimate, consider adding the user to a suppression list.
  3. If the action is unauthorized:
     * Contact the user (the user's ARN) to confirm if they made the API call.
     * Check the User Investigation dashboard for other actions taken by the user (the user's ARN).
     * Check the IP Investigation dashboard for additional traffic from the IP (the client IP).
  4. If the triage results suggest an attacker is involved, initiate the incident response process and investigation.
