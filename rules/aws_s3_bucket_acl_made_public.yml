name: AWS S3 Bucket ACL made public
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an S3 bucket policy is made public.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail API calls to detect when an AWS bucket is made public:

  * PutBucketAcl

  Inspect the AccessControlPolicy.AccessControlList.Grant.Grantee.URI array for:
  * `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers`
  * `http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers`

  A match with either indicates the S3 bucket policy is public.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user identity is expected to perform the event name API call.
  2. Contact the principal owner to confirm if this API call was made by the user.
  3. If the API call was unauthorized, rotate the user credentials and investigate other successful API accesses:
     * Rotate the credentials.
     * Check for other unauthorized API calls with the same credentials.
