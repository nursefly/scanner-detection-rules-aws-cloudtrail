name: AWS Java_Ghost security group creation attempt
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect attempts to create an AWS security group named "Java_Ghost."

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for the creation of the security group "Java_Ghost." A high-confidence assessment indicates that this event likely signifies a compromised identity. An attacker may create a security group to maintain access to EC2 instances.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Review past activity and API calls made by the compromised identity.
  2. Initiate your company's incident response process and conduct an investigation.
