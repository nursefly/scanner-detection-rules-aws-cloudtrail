name: New Public Repository Container Image detected in AWS ECR
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect new image uploads to public ECR, which may indicate potential data exfiltration or supply chain risks.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor when an event named "PutImage" is used against the public ECR API.

  ## Triage & Response
  1. Verify that the image ID is a valid SHA256 hash for the container image with the specified tag in the designated repository on the AWS account.
  2. If the hash is invalid, investigate whether the container image was uploaded for malicious reasons.
