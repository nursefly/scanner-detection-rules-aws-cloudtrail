description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user deletes a behavior graph in Amazon Detective.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor the DeleteGraph API call to identify when a behavior graph is deleted.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the behavior graph deletion was authorized.
  2. Identify which user deleted the behavior graph.
  3. If the deletion was unauthorized:
     * Rotate the credentials.
     * Investigate for any other unauthorized API calls made with the same credentials.
