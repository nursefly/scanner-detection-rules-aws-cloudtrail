name: Security group open to the world
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an AWS security group is opened to the world.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor for the creation or modification of an AWS security group through specific API calls:
  * AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress

  This rule checks the list of IP ranges to see if it includes:
  * 0.0.0.0/0
  * ::/0

  ## Triage and response
  1. Identify the user who made the API call.
  2. Verify with the user if they initiated this API call.
  3. If the API call was unauthorized:
    * Rotate the user's credentials and investigate any other unauthorized API calls.
    * Review other API calls made by the user.
