name: Amazon Bedrock console activity using a long-term access key
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect attempts to access console-only API calls through a long-term access key.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for API calls to console-only APIs that should not originate from long-term access keys. Attackers typically target the AWS Bedrock service to host their own LLM service using the victim's resources.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Confirm if the API call should have been made by the user from the specified IP address.
  2. If the action is legitimate, consider adding the user to a suppression list.
  3. If the action is unauthorized:
     * Contact the user to verify if they made the API call.
     * Investigate the user's other actions.
     * Check for additional traffic from the specified IP address.
  4. If evidence suggests an attack, initiate the incident response process and conduct further investigation.
