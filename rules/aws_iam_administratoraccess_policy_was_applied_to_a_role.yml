name: AWS IAM AdministratorAccess policy was applied to a role
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when the AdministratorAccess policy is attached to an AWS IAM role.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for any instances where the AWS managed policy AdministratorAccess is attached to an AWS IAM role via the AttachRolePolicy API call.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the session name should have executed the API call.
  2. If the API call was not authorized:
    * Rotate user credentials.
    * Investigate other API calls made by the user.
    * Remove the AdministratorAccess policy from the specified role using the AWS CLI detach-role-policy command.
  3. If the API call was legitimate:
    * Assess whether the role needs the AdministratorAccess policy for its functions.
    * Recommend the user find a least privileged policy that meets the role's operational requirements.
