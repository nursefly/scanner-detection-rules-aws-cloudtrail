name: AWS GuardDuty threat intel set deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an attacker is trying to evade defenses by deleting a ThreatIntelSet.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor the CloudTrail API call to detect if an attacker is deleting a ThreatIntelSet:

  * DeleteThreatIntelSet

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Determine if the user should have made the API call.
  2. If the API call was not made by the user:
    * Rotate user credentials.
    * Investigate other API calls made by the user.
    * Restore deleted ThreatIntelSets using AWS CLI or the AWS Console.
  3. If the API call was made by the user:
    * Verify if the user was authorized to perform this API call.
    * If not authorized, check for additional API calls by the user and assess for further investigation.
