name: Possible privilege escalation via AWS login profile manipulation
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect if a user or role attempts to create or update the password for a specific IAM user.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for attempts to create or update a password for an IAM user using the CreateLoginProfile or UpdateLoginProfile API calls.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user session should have made the API call.
  2. If the API call was not made by the user:
    - Rotate user credentials.
    - Investigate other API calls made by the user.
    - Remove any passwords created by the user using the delete-login-profile command or the AWS Console.
  3. If the API call was made by the user:
    - Verify if the user should be making this API call.
    - If not, check for other API calls made by the user to assess if further investigation is necessary.
