name: AWS IAM Roles Anywhere trust anchor created
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a trust anchor for IAM Roles Anywhere is created.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors CloudTrail logs for CreateTrustAnchor API calls. An attacker may establish persistence by creating a trust anchor, which allows non-AWS workloads to assume roles by presenting a client-side X.509 certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority.

  ## Triage & Response
  1. Verify if the API call should have been performed by the user:
     * Contact the user to confirm their involvement.
  2. If the API call was unauthorized:
     * Rotate the user's credentials.
     * Investigate the user's actions and any new access keys created.
     * Initiate your organization's incident response process.
  3. If the API call was legitimate:
     * Ensure that using an IAM Roles Anywhere trust anchor is appropriate for the resource.
