name: AWS AMI Made Public
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an AMI is made public.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail API calls to detect if an AMI is made public by checking the `requestParameters.launchPermission.add.items.group` array for the string "all."

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the AMI (the image ID) should be made public using CloudTrail logs.
  2. Investigate the ARN of the user who made the AMI public.
  3. Contact the user to confirm their intent regarding the public status of the image.
  4. If the user did not make the API call:
      * Rotate the credentials.
      * Investigate if the same credentials were used for other unauthorized API calls.
      * Revert AMI permissions to their original state.
      * Begin your company's incident response process and investigate.
