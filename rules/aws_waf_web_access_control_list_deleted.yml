name: AWS WAF web access control list deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) Access Control List (ACL) is deleted.

  ## Strategy
  The rule monitors AWS WAF logs and detects when the event name is "DeleteWebACL."

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user's identity is expected to perform the "DeleteWebACL" API call on the account.
  2. If the API call was not made by the user, rotate the user credentials and investigate what other APIs were successfully accessed.
