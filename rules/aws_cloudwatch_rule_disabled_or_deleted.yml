name: AWS CloudWatch rule disabled or deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a CloudWatch rule has been disabled or deleted.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for `DisableRule` or `DeleteRule` API calls, as attackers may remove rules to evade defenses.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the user making the API call should have done so.
  2. If the API call was not legitimate:
     * Rotate user credentials.
     * Investigate other API activities by the user.
     * Re-enable or create a rule using the AWS CLI commands `enable-rule` or `put-rule`, or refer to AWS documentation to revert to the last known good state.
  3. If the API call was legitimate:
     * Check if the user was authorized for this change.
     * If authorized, consider adding the event bus name to a suppression list.
     * If not authorized, re-enable or create a rule as previously mentioned and initiate your incident response process to investigate.
