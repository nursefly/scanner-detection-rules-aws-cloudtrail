description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an attacker attempts to evade defenses by deleting a GuardDuty detector.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor the CloudTrail API call to detect if an attacker is deleting a GuardDuty detector:

  * DeleteDetector

  ## Triage and response
  1. Identify the user who owns the API key that made this call.
  2. Contact the user to confirm if they intended to make this call.
  3. If the user did not make the call:
      * Rotate the credentials.
      * Investigate any other unauthorized API calls made with the same credentials.
