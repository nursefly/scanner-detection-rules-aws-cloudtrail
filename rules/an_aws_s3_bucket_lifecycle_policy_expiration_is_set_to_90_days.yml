name: An AWS S3 bucket lifecycle policy expiration is set to < 90 days
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an S3 bucket has a lifecycle configuration with an expiration policy of less than 90 days.

  ## Strategy
  Look for lifecycle configuration rules with expiration days set to less than 90 in your logs.

  **NOTE**: This rule should target the relevant logs. The expiration days key must be used to perform the query.

  ## Triage & Response
  1. Determine if the event should have occurred on the specified bucket by the username, account ID, and type, and verify that the bucket has a file expiration of less than 90 days.
  2. If the bucket is the CloudTrail bucket, consider escalating to higher severity and investigating further.
