name: AWS Route 53 DNS query logging disabled
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user deletes a Route 53 query logging configuration.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor cloudtrail logs for the event name "DeleteResolverQueryLogConfig," which stops Route 53 Query logging for all associated Amazon VPCs.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user identity is expected to perform the "DeleteResolverQueryLogConfig" API call.
  2. Contact the principal owner to verify if the API call was initiated by the user.
  3. If the API call was not user-initiated, rotate user credentials and investigate other successfully accessed APIs.
