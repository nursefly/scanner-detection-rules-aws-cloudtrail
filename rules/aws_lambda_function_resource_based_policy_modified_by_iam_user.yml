name: AWS Lambda function resource-based policy modified by IAM user
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an AWS Lambda function's resource-based policy is modified by an IAM user, which could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or allow invocation from an external account.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor the `AddPermission` CloudTrail API call to identify changes to the AWS Lambda function's resource-based policy.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the IAM user is expected to update the Lambda function based on the function name provided.
  2. Investigate the statement for details on the policy modification.
  3. If the action is legitimate, consider adding the user to a suppression list.
  4. If the action is unauthorized:
     * Contact the IAM user to confirm if they made the API call.
     * Check the User Investigation dashboard for other actions taken by the user.
     * Check the IP Investigation dashboard for additional traffic from the client's IP.
  5. If an attack is suspected, initiate the company's incident response process and conduct further investigation.
