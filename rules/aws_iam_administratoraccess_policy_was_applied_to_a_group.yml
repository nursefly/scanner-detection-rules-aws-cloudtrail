name: AWS IAM AdministratorAccess policy was applied to a group
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when the AdministratorAccess policy is attached to an AWS IAM group.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for instances where an attacker has attached the AdministratorAccess policy to an AWS IAM group using the AttachGroupPolicy API call.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user identity session name should have made an API call.
  2. If the API call was not made by the user:
    * Rotate user credentials.
    * Review other API calls made by the user.
    * Remove the AdministratorAccess policy from the specified group using the aws-cli command to detach the group policy.
  3. If the API call was made legitimately by the user:
    * Assess if the group requires the AdministratorAccess policy for its intended function.
    * Advise the user to find the least privileged policy that allows the group to operate as intended.
