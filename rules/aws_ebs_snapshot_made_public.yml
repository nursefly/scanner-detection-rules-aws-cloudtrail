name: AWS EBS Snapshot Made Public
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an EBS snapshot is made public.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail API calls for EBS snapshot modifications, specifically with the `ModifySnapshotAttribute` call. This rule checks if the `createVolumePermission.add.items.group` array includes the string "all," indicating the snapshot is public.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Confirm if the EBS snapshot should be public.
  2. Identify which user made the snapshot public.
  3. Contact the user to confirm their intent.
  4. If the user did not authorize the change:
      * Rotate the credentials.
      * Investigate other potential unauthorized API calls.
      * Revert AMI permissions to the original state.
      * Initiate the incident response process.
