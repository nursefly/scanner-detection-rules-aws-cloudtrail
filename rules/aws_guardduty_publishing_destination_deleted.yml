name: AWS GuardDuty publishing destination deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user deletes a publishing destination for a detector, which will prevent the exporting of findings.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors the API call to detect if a user has deleted a Guard Duty publishing destination.

  * DeletePublishingDestination

  ## Triage and response
  1. Identify the user who owns the API key that made the API call.
  2. Contact the user to confirm if they intended to make this API call.
  3. If the user did not make the API call:
      * Rotate the credentials.
      * Investigate if the same credentials made other unauthorized API calls.
