name: AWS EventBridge rule disabled or deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect attempts to evade defenses by deleting or disabling EventBridge rules.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor specific CloudTrail API calls to detect modifications or disabling of EventBridge rules:

  * DeleteRule
  * DisableRule

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user identity should have made the API call for the event name.
  2. Contact the user to verify their intent regarding the API call.
  3. If the user denies making the API call:
      * Rotate the credentials.
      * Investigate any other unauthorized API calls made with the same credentials.

  **NOTE:** Tune out valid user agents that trigger this alert. For guidance, refer to relevant tuning resources.
