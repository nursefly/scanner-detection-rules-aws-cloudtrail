name: AWS RDS Cluster deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user deletes a database cluster in RDS.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor the relevant CloudTrail API call for RDS cluster deletions:

  * DeleteDBCluster

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the API call (the event name) should have occurred.
  2. If it shouldn't have been made:
     * Contact the user (user identity) to confirm if they made the API call.
  3. If the API call was not made by the user:
     * Rotate the user credentials.
     * Investigate other API calls made with the old credentials that were not authorized by the user.
