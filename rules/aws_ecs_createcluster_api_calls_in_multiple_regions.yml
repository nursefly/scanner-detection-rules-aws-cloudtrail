name: AWS ECS CreateCluster API calls in multiple regions
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect attempts to create AWS ECS clusters in multiple regions.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for attempts to create AWS ECS clusters in multiple regions. This could indicate malicious activities like cryptocurrency mining.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user identity should have performed this operation.
  2. If the API calls were unauthorized:
    * Rotate user credentials.
    * Remove the newly created cluster and any associated tasks or services.
    * Investigate what other API calls were made by the user.
    * Initiate your organization's incident response process.
