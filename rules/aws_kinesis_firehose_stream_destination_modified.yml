name: AWS Kinesis Firehose stream destination modified
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detects when an AWS Kinesis Firehose Destination is modified.

  ## Strategy
  The rule monitors AWS Kinesis Firehose logs and detects when the event name is "UpdateDestination."

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user identity is expected to perform the "UpdateDestination" API call on the account.
  2. If the API call was not made by the user, rotate the user credentials and investigate other successfully accessed APIs.
     * Rotate the credentials.
     * Investigate if the same credentials made other unauthorized API calls.
