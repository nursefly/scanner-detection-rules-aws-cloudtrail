name: Amazon S3 bucket policy modified
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect modifications to S3 Bucket policies.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for modifications to S3 policies via the following API calls:
  * PutBucketAcl
  * PutBucketPolicy
  * PutBucketCors
  * PutBucketLifecycle
  * PutBucketReplication
  * DeleteBucketPolicy
  * DeleteBucketCors
  * DeleteBucketReplication

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Identify the user who made the API call.
  2. Contact the user to confirm whether they initiated the API call.
  3. If the call was unauthorized:
     * Rotate the user's credentials and investigate other API calls they made.
     * Identify additional API calls made by the user that were not authorized.
