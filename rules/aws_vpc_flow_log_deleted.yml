name: AWS VPC Flow Log deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when one or more AWS VPC Flow Logs are deleted.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for deletions of AWS VPC Flow Logs via the DeleteFlowLogs API.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Verify if the API call regarding the event name should have occurred.
  2. If the action was legitimate, consider allowing the invoking service or user through a suppression list.
  3. If the action was not legitimate:
     - Contact the user to confirm if they made the API call.
  4. If the API call was unauthorized:
     - Rotate the user credentials.
     - Investigate other API calls made with the old credentials that were not authorized by the user.
