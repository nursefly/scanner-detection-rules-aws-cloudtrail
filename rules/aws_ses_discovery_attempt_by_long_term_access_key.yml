name: AWS SES discovery attempt by long term access key
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect attempts to check the status of an organization's Amazon SES account.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for attempts to assess the status of an organization's Amazon SES account. Attackers typically target AWS SES for phishing. They may use the API calls "GetAccount" or "ListServiceQuotas" to check the sending quota or to see if the account is in a sandbox.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the API call should have been made by the user from the specified IP address.
  2. If the action is legitimate, consider adding the user to a suppression list.
  3. If the action is unauthorized:
     * Contact the user to confirm if they made the API call.
     * Check the user investigation dashboard for other actions taken by the user.
     * Check the IP investigation dashboard for additional traffic from the IP.
  4. If the triage results suggest an attack, initiate your company's incident response process and investigation.
