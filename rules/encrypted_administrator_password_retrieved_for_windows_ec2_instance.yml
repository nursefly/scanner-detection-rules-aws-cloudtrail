name: Encrypted administrator password retrieved for Windows EC2 instance
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user attempts to retrieve the encrypted Administrator password for a Windows EC2 instance.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for attempts to retrieve the encrypted Administrator password using the GetPasswordData API call.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Verify if the user should have made the API call.
  2. If the API call was not made by the user:
     * Rotate user credentials.
     * Check other API calls made by the user.
  3. If the API call was made by the user:
     * Determine if the user should access the EC2 instance.
     * If yes, advise them to speak with the instance owner to resolve the issue.
     * If no, review other API calls made by the user for further investigation.
