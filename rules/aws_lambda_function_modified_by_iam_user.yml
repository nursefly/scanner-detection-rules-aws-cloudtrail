name: AWS Lambda function modified by IAM user
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an IAM user modifies an AWS Lambda function, which could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data in an AWS environment.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor the `UpdateFunctionCode` CloudTrail API call to identify modifications to an AWS Lambda Function.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the IAM user is expected to update the Lambda function specified by the function name.
  2. If the action is legitimate, consider adding the user to a suppression list.
  3. If the action is unauthorized:
     * Contact the user to confirm if they made the API call.
     * Check the User Investigation dashboard for other actions taken by the user.
     * Review the IP Investigation dashboard for additional traffic from the client's IP.
  4. If an attack is suspected, initiate your organization's incident response process and investigation.
