name: AWS ECS cluster deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an attacker is destroying an ECS Cluster.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor the DeleteCluster API call to detect if an ECS cluster is deleted.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user identity should be making the delete API call.
  2. Contact the user to see if they intended to make this API call.
  3. If the user did not make the API call:
      * Rotate the credentials.
      * Investigate if the same credentials made other unauthorized API calls.
