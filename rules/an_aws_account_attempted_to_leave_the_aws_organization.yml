name: An AWS account attempted to leave the AWS Organization
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect an AWS account attempting to leave an AWS organization.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for attempts to have an AWS account leave an organization using the LeaveOrganization API call. An attacker may attempt this for reasons such as:

  * Targeting security configurations defined at the organization level, disrupting or disabling these controls.
  * Executing a denial of service (DoS) attack that prevents access to the victim's account.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if the user identity should have made the event name API call.
  2. If the API call was not made by the user:
     * Rotate user credentials.
     * Review other API calls made by the user.
     * Initiate your company's incident response process.
  3. If the API call was made legitimately by the user:
     * Communicate with the user to confirm if this was a planned action.
     * If not planned, review other API calls by the user for further investigation.
     * Initiate your company's incident response process.
