name: AWS CloudWatch log group deleted
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a CloudWatch Log Group is deleted.

  ## Strategy
  Detect a successful event named "DeleteLogGroup".

  ## Triage and response
  1. Ensure the log group is not used for auditing or security purposes.
  2. If it is:
      * Verify that the user making this API call is authorized in your environment.
      * Consider adding the log group name to a suppression list.
  3. If it is not for auditing or security, initiate your company's incident response process and investigate.
