name: AWS SES email sending enabled in current AWS region
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when email sending is enabled in your Amazon SES account for the current AWS region.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail for events indicating email sending has been enabled in Amazon SES. Attackers often target SES for phishing, using API calls to enable email sending.

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Determine if the API call should have been made by the user from this IP address.
  2. If the action is legitimate, consider adding the user to a suppression list.
  3. If the action is suspicious:
     * Contact the user to verify if they made the API call.
     * Check the User Investigation dashboard for other actions taken by the user.
     * Review the IP Investigation dashboard for additional traffic from the IP.
  4. If findings suggest an attack, initiate your company's incident response process and investigation.
