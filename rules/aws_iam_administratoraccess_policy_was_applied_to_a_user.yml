name: AWS IAM AdministratorAccess policy was applied to a user
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when the AdministratorAccess policy is attached to an AWS IAM user.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor CloudTrail to identify if an attacker has attached the AWS managed AdministratorAccess policy to an AWS IAM user using the AttachUserPolicy API call.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify if the session name should have made the API call.
  2. If the API call was not made by the user:
     * Rotate the user's credentials.
     * Investigate other API calls made by the user.
     * Remove the AdministratorAccess policy from the specified user using the aws-cli command to detach the user policy.
  3. If the API call was made legitimately:
     * Assess if the user requires the AdministratorAccess policy for their tasks.
     * Advise the user to seek the least privileged policy that meets their operational needs.
